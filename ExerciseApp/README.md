Hello Professor!

I put this project together including all the required features. I feel a learned a lot about web servers and especially with working with Angular writing this project up, and everything I learned in class really came together.

I ran into problems with some of the features, mostly having to do with logging in. I have no experience working with databases yet so I opted against using one, which is necessary to create a proper login system, so the login system in my project simply uses
localStorage instead. This is definitely not how I would do it in a professional setting however it functions fairly well to demonstrate the website. It is by no means secure, but logging in wasn't a required feature and I had to get moving on getting the website's actual functionality down.

The CSS and styling for the project could definitely use some work to be up to modern standards, but the view is readable and demonstrates the various features well enough I feel, especially since I went in to this class without much experience using HTML and CSS.

The features Angular provides were very useful. I mostly made use of services to store the user state and made a singleton entity that is provided to all of the project's components, allowing every component to have access to a single instance of the service. This makes it so the website keeps track of the user's login status and various information, such as the profile data and workout log data even after the user has navigated away from the page.

Overall I feel this project would be greatly improved with the use of a database to store the user's information safely server-side rather than client-side as it is implemented now, but my knowledge of PHP is zero and I am only just this semester learning SQL so I decided to take the client-side rout.

Lastly the Google+ share button doesn't work unless the website gets posted to the internet, since Google's systems crawl the site before creating the link and it can't do that on a site that's hosted locally. So it'd work if the site had a real domain.

Thanks a lot for the semester, the class was very practical which was a breath of fresh air after learning mostly skills related to Computer Science theory rather than programming and implementation skills like I learned in your class.


Post final: The typeahead feature is located in the login page if you can't find it.
